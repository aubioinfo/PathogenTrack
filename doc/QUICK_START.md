Quick start guide
--------------------

This quick start guide uses an reduced dataset generated by 10X Genomics (SRA) as an example.

  * [Step 1: Install `PathogenTrack`](#step-1-install-pathogentrack)
  * [Step 2: Download the test data](#step-2-download-the-test-data)
  * [Step 3: ]

The following steps will guide you through a short tutorial of how to use the `PathogenTrack` 
package to process scRNA data and identify and quantify pathogen species at the single-cell level.
The data used comes from a gastric patient sequenced by 10X Genomics technology ([Zhang Peng, et al. 
*Cell reports (2019): 1934-1947](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31067475/)). We have subset the 
data to reduce its size.
