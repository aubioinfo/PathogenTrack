# Pathogen-Track
Pathogen-Track is a python-based computational software based on **---** and **---** developped to detect and identify pathogenic microorganisms from single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) raw data. This tool was tested on various scRNA-seq datasets derived from human tumor samples as described in our paper *'Detecting and studying pathogenic microorganisms invasion at the single-cell resolution using Pathogen-Track'*.
